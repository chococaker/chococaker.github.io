            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>Hello! My name is John Jerney and I&rsquo;m a senior in high school. In the future, I want to be a computer science professor or researcher. In my free time, I enjoy programming, playing music, and binging YouTube.</p>
            <p><b>Mission Statement: </b>I want explore the intersection of technology and education, inspiring individuals of all ages to innovate using tools that solve theoretical problems and drive real-world improvement.</p>
            <br /><hr /><br />

            <h1>STEM Activities</h1>

            <p>I like to think of myself as rather involved in STEM, though I still have a long way to go :&#41;</p>

                    <p>I work as am intern @ Ion Concert Media. It&rsquo;s fun work involving working with ways to control lightning and cues, as well as things like AWS, server management, and much more.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m computer systems programmer in a top #39 worldwide robotics team, The Green Machine! The team is part of the FIRST Robotics Competition organisation, and our team number is 1816.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, I&rsquo;m working on autonomous systems for the robot for things like autopathing and aim, as well as the app we use for scouting other teams.</p>

                    <p>The math team is one of my main focuses for this academic year: I&rsquo;ve been steadily improving at doing high-level mathematics and hope to be able to be one of the ten representatives for my school. Wish me luck!</p>

                    <p>Both a configurator and a programmer at several Minecraft servers, some of which garnering hundreds of players per month.</p>
                    <p>I don&rsquo;t do much of this anymore, since I&rsquo;ve decided to focus a bit more on academics. I might come back at some point, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;ll do so in the very near future.</p>

            <h1>Misc</h1>

            <p>I&rsquo;m not just a programmer! I have other things I do in my free time.</p>

                        <h2>Orchestral Music</h2>
                        <p>I enjoy playing the contrabass, cello and piano, though I mainly play the contrabass. I&rsquo;m assistant principal at both the <a href="https://mmea.org/events/all-state/"  target="_blank">Minnesota All-State Orchestra</a> as well as <a href="https://gtcys.org/programs/orchestras/philharmonic"  target="_blank">GTCYS Philharmonic</a>, and principal bassist in my school.</p>

                        <h2>Mathnasium</h2>
                        <p>I work as a tutor at Mathnasium, teaching 1st-9th graders all about math in their respective learning levels.</p>
                        <p>Meeting new people every day, finding out how they learn and trying to compound on that has been an immensely valuable experience.</p>

                        <h2>Tutoring</h2>
                        <p>I tutor middle schoolers, teaching things like mathematics, social studies, and general knowledge taught from sixth to eigth grade.</p>
                        <p>One day, I hope to become a professor at a college, and these are my first steps into learning how to teach others.</p>

            <h1>Awards/Certs</h1>

            <p>Here&rsquo;s where you can see all the various bits and bobs I&rsquo;ve gathered along the way.</p>
            <div class="collapsed-section-wrapper">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Inspirit AI Scholar</h2>
                        <p>I completed the Inspirit AI Scholars program over my tenth-grade spring break. It taught me the basics of what machine learning is, and granted me the fundamentals to at some point invest more time into it and learn what it truly is.</p>
                        <p>Right now, though, I&rsquo;m working on projects that are largely unrelated to AI. Hopefully I can get more involved in the future.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>CodeWithMosh Certs</h2>
                        <p>Went through a huge phase in my sophomore year where I absolutely grinded CodeWithMosh. He&rsquo;s partially my inspiration for wanting to be a computer science educator.</p>
                        <p>I have completed the C++ Advanced, Java Advanced, JavaScript Advanced, and Python Advanced, and am working on SQL and Data Structures through Mosh&rsquo;s amazing lectures.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>CS50 Cert</h2>
                        <p>Certified completion of Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 Course. I took the course less to learn computer science and more to learn how Professor David Malan teaches. I was not disappointed—much of my own teaching is now reminiscent of his confident, analogy-based lecturing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>National Merit Commended Scholar</h2>
                        <p>I scored among the top 5% of PSAT takers in the nation. Sadly, I narrowly missed the window for the top 1%.</p>
